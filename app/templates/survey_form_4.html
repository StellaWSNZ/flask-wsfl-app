        Assessing Creativity in Relating Water Skills for Life Activities to
        Real World Open Water Scenarios
      </h3>
      <p class="text-muted">
        Assessing creativity in a Water Skills for Life lesson involves
        evaluating how well the instructor helps students connect activities to
        real-world open water scenarios. Key criteria include clearly explaining
        the relevance of each activity to open water environments, adapting the
        competencies to reflect realistic challenges, and encouraging students
        to understand the 'why' behind each skill. The instructor should foster
        critical thinking and creative problem-solving by relating the skills to
        practical, real-life situations. Students' creativity is measured by
        their ability to apply these competencies to different open water
        scenarios and adapt their skills effectively. Overall, creativity in a
        Water Skills for Life lesson is about making activities relatable to
        real-world contexts and ensuring students grasp the practical importance
        of what they are learning.
